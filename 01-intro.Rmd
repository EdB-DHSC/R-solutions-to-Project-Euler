# Introduction {#intro}

There's lots of intro to R books on [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/), why do we need another?

Ultimately, we don't - but I hope that this project will be useful for students and contributors.

For students, I like the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems for learning a language. It's my hope that worked examples will be useful to someone.

For contributors, they say you don't understand something properly until you can explain it to someone else. So contributors can gain something from submitting solutions via a GitHub Pull Request. (TODO: link to project's GH)
